#### What is S3?
S3 is a cloud storage service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). 
For small amounts of data, it's free. For larger amounts, it's very cheap. It can be used to store backups, or to host static websites.

#### What is Total Commander?
Total Commander is a file manager for Windows. It's a great tool for power users, and it's highly customizable.

# Usage

### Start using the plugin
1. Installed the plugin. [See installation](#installation)
2. Open the plugin: 
     - <kbd>Alt+F1</kbd>, then <kbd> \ </kbd>. (Network Neighborhood)
     - Select "S3" from the list.
3. Connect to S3
   - The plugin will automatically attempt to use your default AWS credentials.
   - If you have multiple AWS accounts, you can select the account to use from the list.
4. Pick one of your buckets from the list.

5. You can now browse, create, delete, upload, download, rename, copy, and move files and folders.

### Copy/move files between two S3 buckets
To copy/move files between two S3 buckets, open another instance of the plugin on the other pane and select the other bucket.

### Change AWS account
To change the AWS account, go up to the parent folder.
There's a "file" called `[PICK AWS PROFILE]`. When you open it, you'll see a list of all your AWS accounts.
Select the account you want.

### Download/upload files
To download a file, make sure to have S3 opened in one pane, and a local drive on the other.
Select the files you want to copy or move, and press <kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>F6</kbd> to copy or move them.

### Creating a new bucket
To create a new bucket, go up to the parent folder, and press F7.
Enter the name of the bucket you want to create, and press enter.
It'll create a button, which is "private" by default.
For now, if you want to change the permissions, you'll have to do that in the [AWS console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home)

### Deleting a bucket
To delete a bucket, go up to the parent folder, and press <kbd>F8</kbd>.
It'll ask you to confirm the deletion. Watch out, because this is irreversible!

# Support
This plugin was mainly built to scratch my own itch, in my spare time. 
I'm sharing it for free because I thought somebody else might find it useful.

The more positive feedback I get, the more motivated I am to improve it.
